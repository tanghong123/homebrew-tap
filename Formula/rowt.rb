  def install
    # rowt resolves its own dir via BASH_SOURCE (parent of bin/), so keep the
    # tree together in libexec and symlink the entry point onto PATH.
    libexec.install "bin", "config", "lima"
    bin.install_symlink libexec/"bin/rowt"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      First run:
        rowt fetch          # download sing-box (or it uses the brew one)
        rowt onboard        # guided setup — shows the next step

      CLI tools ignore the macOS system proxy. To get the rowt-proxy-on /
      rowt-proxy-off aliases (point this shell's CLI env at rowt, or clear it),
      add this line to your ~/.zshrc (after `brew shellenv`):
        eval "$(rowt shell-init)"

      Mode `vm` additionally needs Lima + socket_vmnet:
        brew install lima socket_vmnet
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "rowt 1.3.0", shell_output("#{bin}/rowt version")
  end
end
